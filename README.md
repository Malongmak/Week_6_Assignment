Submission of AI Generated Codes is not Permitted (0 will be given as a grade)
Tasks to Complete

Qn 1. Music Playlist Manager

Assessment Goals:

Implement a linked list with the right applications of algorithms.
Play music in C
Tasks:

Implement a system to manage a playlist of songs (every node is a song with a name, and time length as the details).
A new song to the list, every new song will be appended to the end of the playlist.
The play starts from the beginning of the linked list. Once the song completes, the next song will be played.
Qn2. Binary Search Tree (BST) for Databases

Assessment Goals:

Store data in BST
Access and manipulate data in a BST
Implement a database.
Tasks:

Implement a simple database system where data is stored in a binary search tree.
Insert new products (node) with details like product ID, name, price, and quantity.
Search for products by name.
Update product details.
Display products in sorted order.
Track out-of-stock products.
Qn3. Recommendation System in Social Networks

Assessment Goals:

Use graphs in real-world applications
Search through a graph using DFS
Tasks:

Create a recommendation system that uses DFS to suggest new connections
Represent users as nodes and connections as edges in a graph.
Use DFS to explore the network and find potential new connections.
Recommend each node new members that are found in its network without a direct connection.

Qn4. Emergency Room Patient Management
Assessment Goals:

Implement heaps (max-heap)
Traverse the heap
Heapify the heap
 

Tasks:

Store patients in a max-heap based on the severity of their condition.
Extract the patient with the highest severity for treatment.
Update the severity as conditions change.
Display the current queue of patients waiting for treatment.

Criteria	Ratings	Pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomePlaylist Manager
The program that leverages linked list data structures and algorithms to play music
3 to >2.0 pts
Full Marks
The Program submitted implements a linked list where every node is a song with a name and time length. The program would allow the user to add a new song which will be appended at the tail of the list. The user would use the program to play the songs where playing would start from the beginning.
2 to >1.0 pts
Good
The program submitted works exactly like in the full marks rating but the details (name and time length). Otherwise, playing music, adding a new song and taking the next song upon completing the previous.
1 to >0.0 pts
Fair
The program works well but only played a static list of music predetermined.
0 pts
No Marks
No submission or incorrect submission
3 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeDatabase Implementation
Use Binary Search to create a database
4 to >3.0 pts
Full Marks
The submission is an implemented database that stores data in a binary search tree for products where for each product there will be product ID, product name, product price, and product quantity. Search products by name Update product details like quantities Display the products in ascending order by name Display the products that are out of the stock
3 to >2.0 pts
Good
The program works exactly like in the full marks rating but can only update one field of the product
2 to >1.0 pts
Fair
The program works in the full marks but fails to identify out of stock items and hence does not display those elements
1 to >0.0 pts
Fair
The program only performs one of the operations either searches, adds a product, or returns products in ascending order
0 pts
No Marks
No submission, or incorrect submission or implement without using BST
